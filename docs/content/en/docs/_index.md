## About

m9sweeper is a free and easy kubernetes security platform. It integrates industry standard open source utilities
into a one-stop-shop kubernetes security tool.

## Why m9sweeper

**Today, technology is relied upon for the goods and services we need**.

Everything from agriculture to transportation to good and services is orchestrated through
information systems. And increasingly, these information systems are deployed using kubernetes.

**Kubernetes is a wonderful tool, but few administrators know much about kubernetes security**

And even in organizations where its administrators have learned about kubernetes security, few administrators are given
adequate time to secure their clusters.

**m9sweeper makes this easy by giving you a solid platform for securing your kubernetes cluster.**

The learning curve is low. The tools it uses are rock-solid and endorsed by the Linux Foundation. All are even covered
by the CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security) examination, which tests ones knowledge of how to secure a kubernetes
cluster. m9sweeper makes kubernetes security *finally accessible* (and free!) for every kubernetes administrator.
